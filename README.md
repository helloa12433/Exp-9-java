# Spring & Hibernate Integration Project

This project demonstrates three core concepts commonly used in enterprise-level Java applications:

## ✅ Part A — Dependency Injection in Spring (Java-Based Configuration)

- Demonstrates how Spring IoC Container works.
- Implements **Dependency Injection** without using XML files.
- Uses `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, and component classes to wire dependencies.
- Shows loose coupling and modular code design.

### Key Features:
- Java-based Spring configuration
- Beans managed by the Spring container
- No XML configuration required

---

## ✅ Part B — Hibernate Application for Student CRUD Operations

This module uses **Hibernate ORM** to interact with the database and perform basic operations on a `Student` entity:

- Create (Insert)
- Read (Retrieve)
- Update
- Delete

### Highlights:
- Hibernate configuration using `hibernate.cfg.xml`
- Entity mapping using annotations
- Session handling for database interaction
- Demonstrates object–relational mapping concepts

---

## ✅ Part C — Transaction Management Using Spring & Hibernate

- Integrates Spring with Hibernate to manage transactions declaratively.
- Uses `@Transactional` annotation for automatic rollback/commit.
- Prevents data inconsistency in case of runtime errors.
- Demonstrates ACID properties in enterprise applications.

### What it Solves:
- Eliminates boilerplate transaction code
- Improves consistency and reliability
- Seamless integration between Spring and Hibernate

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Spring Framework**
- **Hibernate ORM**
- **MySQL / H2 Database (optional)**
- **Maven/Gradle (optional Build Tool)**

## 📂 Project Structure (General Idea)


---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Install Java JDK
2. Configure database (MySQL/H2)
3. Add required dependencies (Spring, Hibernate)
4. Run the `Main` class
5. Observe console output for DI, CRUD, and transaction results

---

## 📝 Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, you will understand:

✅ How Spring performs Dependency Injection  
✅ How Hibernate maps Java objects to database tables  
✅ How Spring manages transactions over Hibernate  
✅ Real enterprise integration pattern  

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on demonstration of how Spring and Hibernate work together in real-world enterprise applications. It covers dependency injection, ORM-based CRUD operations, and reliable transaction management.
